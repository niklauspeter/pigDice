## Description
The application allows two users to play the game whereby each takes turns to roll the dice. the program then assigns random numbers ranging from 1-6, simulating the sides of a dice. If any of the player gets a score of one, they are not awarded any marks. if they hold their score, it is added cumulatively to their previous score and shifts to the next player. The game ends when any of the player reaches a score of 100 first and is hence declared the winner.
## Setup/Installation Requirements

## Known Bugs
