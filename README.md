## Description
The application allows two users to play a game whereby, each takes turns to roll a dice. the program then assigns random numbers ranging from 1-6, simulating the sides of a dice. If any of the player gets a score of one, they are not awarded any marks. if they hold their score, it is added cumulatively to their previous score and shifts to the next player. The game ends when any of the player reaches a score of 100 first and is hence declared the winner.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* set the webs URL https://niklauspeter.github.io/pigDice/ in your browsers or current search engine.
* once the website is click on the highligted text "press here to start game".
* once the game is over click the home button or refresh the browser to begin again

The code doesn't currently need a database nor does it depend on any application to run.
## Known Bugs
The system currenly has one bug whereby, if a random number of one is generated, it clears all the users previous scores.i'm working on debugging this.
